Ever since I started coding, it was always my goal to recreate this game, and I was finally able to accomplish this goal. I used Java for both the front end and the back end, utilizing the Swing library and the Abstract Window Toolkit. When creating my project, the main logic I used to create the snake was a reversed Linked List to create the chaining effect. Overall, this was a fun project to work on and a very fulfilling experience. Here is my project link: ',

        description: 'This is my recreation of Tetris. After creating Snake, I wanted to create another personal project to help solidify some of the concepts that I learned in Object-Oriented Programming, such as concurrency, polymorphism, GUIs, etc. Similarly to Snake, I used Java with the Swing library and the Abstract Window Toolkit. This game is slightly incomplete, as I havenâ€™t added music or cooler graphics, but I got a very baseline project finished. Overall, I learned a lot from creating this project and enjoyed this!

Additionally, I want to display all of my current and future personal projects on this website. This project helped me develop front end skills that I can use for more complex projects in the future. Overall, this was a really fun project to work on, and I plan on using the front end skills I learned to make more projects in the future.',
