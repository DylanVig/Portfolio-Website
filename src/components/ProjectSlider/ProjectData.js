Ever since I started coding, it was always my goal to recreate this game, and I was finally able to accomplish this goal. I used Java for both the front end and the back end, utilizing the Swing library and the Abstract Window Toolkit. When creating my project, the main logic I used to create the snake was a reversed Linked List to create the chaining effect. Overall, this was a fun project to work on and a very fulfilling experience. Here is my project link: ',
