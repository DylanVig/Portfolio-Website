This is my personal Portfolio Website! On this website, I discuss my hobbies, my academic/professional experience, and personal projects that I have developed. I used React to create this website, and I also used multiple components online to help build some of the sections of my website like the experience and projects page. Thanks for reading!

This Project does not seem to format correctly on older versions of Mac OS, so please make sure you view this on an updated browser version (whichever browser that may be).
